### Things to know when Pair Programming with me:

1. I like being able to bounce ideas off each other and take turns implementing in a collaborative manner to figure out difficult solutions!

2. I'll always try to write some form of documentation for the code I'm working on to ensure the past, present, and future us will understand what we've been working on!

3. I will always be transparent with what I know and don't know, and that I will always try to find someone or something to help with the solution.

### Languages/Tools 
- C++
- Python 

### Interesting Fact
I am left handed.
